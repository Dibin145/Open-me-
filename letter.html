    <h1>💌 My Dearest Love</h1>

    <p>
        Happy Birthday to the most precious person in my life.  
        You came into my world quietly, but you changed everything beautifully.  
        Your smile is my favorite view, your happiness is my priority,  
        and loving you is the best decision I ever made.
    </p>

    <p>
        I may not be perfect, but my love for you is honest, deep, and forever.  
        I promise to hold your hand in every season of life 🤎
    </p>
